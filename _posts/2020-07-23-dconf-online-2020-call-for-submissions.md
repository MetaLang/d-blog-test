### Maybe Next Time, London!



Due to the onset of COVID-19, [the D Language Foundation](https://dlang.org/foundation/index.html) and [Symmetry Investments](https://symmetryinvestments.com/) decided in early March to cancel DConf 2020, which had been [scheduled to take place June 17-20 in London](https://dconf.org/2020/). DConf has been the premiere D programming language event every year since 2013, the one chance for members of the D community from around the world to gather face-to-face outside of their local meetups for four days of knowledge sharing and comradery. It was a painful decision, but the right one. As of now, we can't say for sure there will be a DConf 2021, but it's looking increasingly unlikely.

Immediately upon reaching the decision to cancel DConf, the obvious question arose of whether we should take the conference online. It was something none of the DConf organizers had any experience with, so we were unwilling to commit to anything until we could figure out a way to go about it that makes sense for our community. As time progressed and we explored our options, the idea became more attractive. Finally, we settled on an approach that we think will work for our community while still allowing outsiders to easily drop by to get a look at our favorite programming language.

We also decided that this is _not_ going to be an online substitute for the real-world DConf. That's why we've named it DConf Online 2020 and not DConf 2020 Online. We're planning to make this an annual event. The real-world DConf will still take place in spring or summer (barring pandemics or other unforeseen circumstances), and DConf Online six months or so later. Without the DConf cancellation, we never would have reached this point, so for us that's a bit of a bright side to these dark days.



### DConf on YouTube



DConf Online will take place on [the D Language Foundation's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNdmeE-_lS6VhCVydkVvQ). The event will kick off with a pre-recorded keynote from Walter Bright, the creator and co-maintainer of D, on November 21, scheduled to premiere at a yet-to-be-determined time. Other pre-recorded talks will be scheduled to premiere throughout the weekend, including a Day Two keynote on November 22 from co-maintainer Átila Neves. Presenters from the pre-recorded talks will be available for livestreamed question and answer sessions just as they would be in the real-world DConf. 

We'll also be livestreaming an Ask Us Anything session, a DConf tradition, with Walter and Átila. We're looking for other ideas for livestream panels. Anyone submitting a panel proposal should either be willing to moderate the panel or have already found someone to commit to the position.

And we really, really want to have at least two livecoding sessions. Anyone familiar with D who has experience livecoding is welcome to submit a proposal. Ideally, we're looking for sessions that present a solid demonstration of D in use, preferably a small project designed exclusively for the livestream, something that can be developed from start to finish in no more than 90 minutes. We aren't looking for tutorial style sessions that go into great detail on a feature or two (though that sort of thing is great for a pre-recorded talk submission!), but something that shows how a D program comes together and what D features look like in action.

Everything you need to know to submit a pre-recorded talk, panel, or livecoding session to the D Language Foundation can be found at [the DConf Online 2020 web site](https://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html). We'll have more details here and on the web site in the coming weeks as our plans solidify. Oh, and everyone whose submission is accepted will receive some swag from [the DLang Swag Emporium](https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326) (DConf Online 2020 swag is coming soon).



### BeerConf



It's a DConf tradition that a gathering spot is selected where attendees can get together each evening for drinks, food, and conversation. For many attendees, this is a highlight of the conference. The opportunity to engage in conversation with so many smart, like-minded people is not one to be missed. [Ethan Watson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nro3txFndbM&list=PLIldXzSkPUXWbpH8ypKeEyDWVqpeZ9CfE&index=15) dubbed these evening soirees "BeerConf", and the name has stuck.

Recently, Ethan and other D community members have been gathering for a monthly online #BeerConf. Given that it's such an integral part of the DConf experience, we hope to make use of the lessons they're learning to run a BeerConf in parallel to DConf Online, starting on the 20th. Despite the name, no one will be expected to drink alcohol of any kind. It's all about getting together to socialize as close to face-to-face as we can get online.

More details regarding BeerConf will be announced closer to the conference dates, so keep an eye on the blog!



### SAOC 2020



[Symmetry Autumn of Code](https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/) is an annual event where a handful of lucky programmers get paid to write some D code. Sponsored by Symmetry Investments, SAOC 2020 is the third edition of the event. Although priority is given to university students, SAOC is open to anyone over 18.

Applicants send a project proposal and a short bio to the D Language Foundation. Those who are selected will be required to work on their project at least 20 hours per week from September 15, 2020, until January 15, 2021. The event consists of four milestones. Participants who meet their goals for the first three milestones will each receive a payment of $1000. For the fourth milestone, the SAOC Committee will evaluate each participant's progress for the entire event. On that basis, one will be selected to receive a final $1000 payment and a free trip to the next real-world DConf (no registration fee; travel and lodging expenses reimbursed on the same terms as offered to DConf speakers). The lucky participant will be asked to submit a proposal for the same DConf they attend, but their proposal will be evaluated in the same manner as all proposals (i.e., acceptance is not guaranteed), but they are guaranteed free registration and reimbursement regardless.

Although Roberto Romaninho, our SAOC 2019 selectee, was robbed of the opportunity to attend DConf 2020, he will still be eligible to make use of his reward at our next real-world event along with the 2020 selectee. Francesco Gallà, who was selected in the inaugural SAOC 2018, [gave a presentation about his project and the SAOC experience at DConf 2019](https://youtu.be/nk9gQWRvoXM). The runner up, Franceso Mecca, [wrote about his own project for the D Blog](https://dlang.org/blog/2019/07/22/symmetry-autumn-of-code-experience-report-porting-a-fork-based-gc/).

SAOC 2020 applications are open until August 16. [See the SAOC 2020 page](https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/) for all the details on how to apply.
