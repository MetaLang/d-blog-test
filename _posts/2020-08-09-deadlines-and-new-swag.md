### SAOC 2020 Application Deadline



![Symmetry Investments logo](https://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo-1.png)The deadline for Symmetry Autumn of Code (SAOC) 2020 applications is on August 16th. There's work to be done and money to be paid (courtesy of Symmetry Investments). If you know of a project that can keep an eager programmer busy for at least 20 hours a week over the course of four months, please advertise it in the forums and [add it to the project ideas list](https://github.com/dlang/projects/issues) if it isn't already there.

As for potential applicants, remember that experience with D is not necessary. Experience with another language can be transferred to D "on the job", with a mentor to guide the way. Tell your friends and spread the word to other programming communities. This is a great way to bring new faces to the D community and the new ideas they may bring with them. All the information on how to apply and how to become a mentor is available [on the SAOC 2020 page](https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/).

The DConf Online 2020 submission deadline of August 31 will be here before we know it. If you haven't put a submission together yet, head over to [the DConf Online 2020 home page](https://dconf.org/2020/online/index.html) (and/or [the announcement here on the blog](https://dlang.org/blog/2020/07/23/dconf-online-2020-call-for-submissions/)) for the details on what we're looking for and how to go about it. Everyone whose submission is accepted for the event schedule will receive a t-shirt and coffee mug to commemorate the occasion.

For everyone else, those t-shirts and mugs are on sale now at [the DLang Swag Emporium](https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326) along with tote bags and stickers. Remember, all of the money we raise through the store goes straight into the General Fund, which we'll dip into to provide DConf Online 2020 speakers with their free stuff and a few lucky viewers with prizes. Donations made [directly to the General Fund](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NDMzMzE=), or to any of [our ongoing campaigns](https://dlang.org/foundation/donate.html), are also greatly appreciated.
