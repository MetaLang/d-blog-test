The D Blog was born at [DConf 2016](http://dconf.org/2016/) and [the first post](http://dlang.org/blog/2016/06/03/recent-d-foundation-activities/) was published on June 3rd. There were 27 more posts between then and the end of the year, most of which were shared on the usual social media sites. In case some of you in DLand are curious about such things, a year-end stats post is a fun way to kick off the new year.

First, we welcomed 39,471 visitors who viewed a total of 53,013 pages. The top five referrers in terms of page views:



 	
  1. 16,604 -- Reddit

 	
  2.  3,698 -- The D Forums

 	
  3.  3,123 -- Hacker News

 	
  4.  2,847 -- Twitter

 	
  5.  1,759 -- Facebook


The top five countries in terms of page views:

 	
  1. 17,244 -- United States

 	
  2.  4,427 -- Germany

 	
  3.  3,349 -- United Kingdom

 	
  4.  2,251 -- Canada

 	
  5.  1,598 -- France


Several posts included links to D projects at GitHub. Counting both projects and profiles, the top five most-clicked were:

 	
  1. [dlangui](https://github.com/buggins/dlangui)

 	
  2. [atrium](https://github.com/gecko0307/atrium)

 	
  3. [Timur Gafurov](https://github.com/gecko0307)

 	
  4. [voxelman](https://github.com/MrSmith33/voxelman)

 	
  5. [dlib](https://github.com/gecko0307/dlib)


The single most-clicked page was the [DLangUI screenshot page](http://buggins.github.io/dlangui/screenshots.html).

Finally, the top six posts in terms of page views:



 	
  1. 5,865 -- [Find Was Too Damn Slow, So We Fixed It](http://dlang.org/blog/2016/06/16/find-was-too-damn-slow-so-we-fixed-it/)

 	
  2. 5,602 -- [Ruminations on D: An Interview with Walter Bright](https://dlang.org/blog/2016/08/30/ruminations-on-d-an-interview-with-walter-bright/)

 	
  3. 4,267 -- [Project Highlight: DLangUI](http://dlang.org/blog/2016/10/07/project-highlight-dlangui/)

 	
  4. 2,704 -- [Programming in D: A Happy Accident](http://dlang.org/blog/2016/06/29/programming-in-d-a-happy-accident/)

 	
  5. 2,579 -- [Project Highlight: Timur Gafarov](http://dlang.org/blog/2016/09/16/project-highlight-timur-gafarov/)

 	
  6. 2,257 -- [Project Highlight: Voxelman](http://dlang.org/blog/2016/12/30/project-highlight-voxelman/)


The list of posts was intended to be a top-five, but it was interesting that Voxelman was posted only on December 30th and managed to become the sixth most-viewed post on the site.

2016 was the time for the blog to [find its sea legs](http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/get+sea+legs). The coming year will see more [Project Highlights](http://dlang.org/blog/category/project-highlights/) and more guest posters (including Andrei and Walter). We're also looking to expand the scope somewhat, so keep your eyes open for new types of content.

If you would like to write for the D blog, please go and contact the fellow who owns [this GitHub profile](https://github.com/mdparker), where he's showing his email address for the world to see. He would be happy to discuss posts about your D projects, idioms you like to use, tutorials you'd like to share, or anything related to the D Programming Language.

Thanks for tuning in, and Happy 2017!
