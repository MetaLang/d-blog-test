In early January, I announced that [Symmetry Investments is bringing DConf back to London](https://dlang.org/blog/2020/01/04/dconf-2020-double-decker-edition/) for our 2020 edition. At the same time, I said we'd start taking submissions from anyone who wanted to send them in. In the interim, we've fixed our deadlines and prepared to start accepting reservations. There was only one thing remaining before I was ready for the formal call for submissions and opening of early-bird registrations: confirming our invited keynote speaker. Now that he has confirmed, it's all official!


### Invited Keynote


We're excited to welcome Roberto Ierusalimschy to DConf 2020! You may know him from his work as the leading architect of [the Lua programming language](https://www.lua.org/). He's the author of [Programming in Lua](https://store.feistyduck.com/products/programming-in-lua-fourth-edition-ebook) and an [Associate Professor of Computer Science at PUC-Rio](http://www.inf.puc-rio.br/~roberto/) (the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro).

We don't know yet what his talk will about, but it can be about any topic he wants. We'll have more information on that for you when we publish the schedule of all selected talks after April 19.


### Call for Submissions


We are accepting submissions for DConf 2020 until April 12. Authors will be notified of their final status by April 19.

We're eager to see some new faces on the stage this year. If you've never presented at a DConf before, please don't hesitate to send us one or more submissions. One person has already sent in seven!

Unless you're Roberto Ierusalimschy, we prefer topics that are directly or indirectly related to D. We aren't intransigent, though, so we're willing to consider other topics. If someone sends us a proposal that isn't about D but piques our collective interest, we'll certainly give it serious consideration.

Having a talk selected is a great way to get to DConf if you're on a budget. You'll pay no registration fee, plus we'll reimburse your transportation and lodging costs (within reason---five-star hotels and business- or first-class plane tickets aren't on the menu). That's a pretty good deal.

You can find instructions for writing and submitting your submissions on [the DConf 2020 homepage](https://dconf.org/2020/index.html#schedule).


### Early-Bird Registration


Early-bird registration is available at $340, which is 15% off the regular $400 rate. Because we're being sponsored by Symmetry in London once more, we once again must include a 20% VAT. So the total early-bird rate is $408 (similarly, the regular rate with VAT will be $480). We're required by UK law to show you the basic rate and VAT in GBP based on the current HMRC exchange rate. That changes every month, so you can see the latest GPB rates in [the registration section of the DConf 2020 homepage](https://dconf.org/2020/index.html#registration).

There, you'll find options for Flipcause and PayPal. From our perspective, we prefer you [use our Flipcause form](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NzQ0NzA=). That gives you the option to cover the credit card processing fee for us so that 100% of your payment can be put toward DConf expenses. If you choose to uncheck that option, that's fine, too! It will still save us from paying other fees. Every penny we can put toward the expenses helps.

If you do choose to go through PayPal, you have an option for USD and one for GBP. Some registrants told me last year that they get a GBP option even when clicking the USD button. And of course, some register with GBP-based credit cards. However, the GBP button on the DConf 2020 homepage is a fixed amount based on the current HMRC exchange rate. It changes, but only once a month. It may turn out to be cheaper for you than the rate you get from PayPal or your credit card provider. Of course, it could turn out to be more expensive, so if you're looking to save a few pounds, you may want to investigate the different exchange rates if they apply to your situation.


### And Now For Something Completely Different


DConf isn't the only event [Symmetry Investments](https://symmetryinvestments.com/) is sponsoring these days. We recently wrapped up the 2019 edition of the Symmetry Autumn of Code.

This year, we started with [five participants working on five interesting projects](http://dlang.org/blog/2019/08/25/saoc-2019-projects-and-participants/). Each participant was to complete a total of four milestones over four months with guidance from a mentor. At the successful completion of the first three milestones, each participant would receive $1000. At the end of the fourth and final milestone, one participant would be selected to receive one more $1000 payment and an all-expense paid trip to DConf.

As the event played out, we lost one of the participants at the end of Milestone 2. Two more were unable to fully commit to the Milestone 4 deadline (though they promised to continue working on their projects after SAOC). That left two participants for the SAOC review committee to select from. It was a very difficult decision, as both participants did excellent work and received glowing evaluations from their mentors.

Now I can announce that the SAOC 2019 finalist was Roberto Rosmaninho!

Roberto, with his mentor Nicholas Wilson, worked on adding support for [Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR)](https://github.com/tensorflow/mlir) to [LDC, the LLVM-based D compiler](https://github.com/ldc-developers/ldc). He is currently working on putting together pull requests for LDC and intends to work on optimizations going forward. He has also confirmed that he will take advantage of his reward so that we will have at least two Robertos at DConf this year.

As we did [last year with Francesco Gallà](https://youtu.be/nk9gQWRvoXM), the SAOC 2018 finalist, we've asked Roberto to submit a talk this year. He promised to do so. We can't promise his talk will be selected (though the odds are high out of the gate), but he still gets a free trip if it isn't! Besides, we're looking forward to meeting him.

On behalf of the D Language Foundation and Symmetry Investments, I want to thank everyone who participated in SAOC 2019. Keep an eye on this blog for news about future events.

Now go prep your DConf 2020 submissions!
