Welcome to the official D Blog!

My name is Michael Parker. With the launching of The D Blog, I've been fortunate enough to land the role of Blog Author, which means I'll be making most of the posts around here. This blog will become your source for DLang news, inside looks at projects in the D community, and updates on happenings behind the scenes of language development and at the D Foundation. Consider it a complement to Adam Ruppe's excellent weekly summary of D goings on, [This Week in D](http://arsdnet.net/this-week-in-d/). For this inaugural post, I've got three news items to pass along about some of the ways the D Foundation is working to promote D.

Lately, Andrei Alexandrescu has been doing a lot of talking in places other than conference stages. For one, he's been having discussions with the [Tech Lounge Foundation](http://tech-lounge.ro/) in Romania, an organization which, among other endeavors, works to help CS and engineering students and aspiring professionals move beyond their education. Specifically, the D Foundation is interviewing recent graduates and current graduate-level students to explore ideas for high-impact academic and industrial D projects. Not only could this result in a killer project or two for D, it could bring new faces into the community.

A second line of communication is active between Andrei and the [University “Politehnica” of Bucharest](http://www.upb.ro/en/), where he has had talks with the university's Vice President Corneliu Burileanu and Director of the Telecommunications Department Eduard-Cristian Popovici. The focus of these discussions has been on finding opportunities for the university and the D Foundation to collaborate. Potential areas of cooperation in this realm include D-centric courses and joint projects developed with D.

Moving out of Romania and up into Scandanavia, Andrei was scheduled to [host a D workshop](http://ndcoslo.com/workshop/the-d-language-or-the-art-of-going-meta/) on June 6 at NDC Oslo. That has now been canceled because of a scheduling conflict. Instead, he will be presenting a day-long consulting session at Cisco Norway. He will also be presenting a talk on D during lunch. All proceeds from the event will go straight to the D Foundation.

If you have any feedback on the blog theme, I would love to see it over [in the forums](http://forum.dlang.org/). Be sure to keep an eye on this space, or [subscribe to the feed](http://dlang.org/blog/index.php/feed/), so you can stay up to date. And if you maintain a D project large or small, be on the lookout for an email from me. I'm getting ready to pick a target for the D Blog's first project highlight.
