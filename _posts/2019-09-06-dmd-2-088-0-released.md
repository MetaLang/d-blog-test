![Digital Mars logo](http://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d6.png)The newest DMD has rolled off the assembly line and [is ready for download](https://dlang.org/download.html). A total of 58 contributors fixed 58 bugs and introduced 27 major changes to version 2.088.0 of the compiler.

I'm always looking for the big ticket items in a new DMD release to highlight on the blog, but this is a workaday release that isn't showing off anything [too shiny in the changleog](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.088.0.html). Much of it is run-of-the mill maintenance: deprecations, removals, and behavior adjustments. All of that is important, and we all welcome it, but it doesn't make for great reading on the blog. That said, there are a handful of useful additions that I can point to, one of which actually is a big deal when it comes to C++ interop.


### `std::string` and `std::vector`


Thanks to the work Manu Evans has been performing and advocating, C++ interoperability gets a big boost in this release with [bindings to `std::string` and `std::vector`](https://dlang.org/changelog/2.088.0.html#std_string) in the DRuntime modules `core.stdcpp.string` and `core.stdcpp.vector`, respectively.  There's one caveat with the `std::string` binding that anyone intending to use it must be aware of.

When compiling on Linux, where DMD makes use of the GCC libraries and linker, there's a compatibility issue when using the modern version of `std::string` which [is compliant with C++11](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/libstdc++/manual/using_dual_abi.html). It contains an interior pointer, which in D is both illegal and incompatible with move semantics. The work around is to pass `-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0` to g++ and compile your D application with `-version=_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX98_ABI`. This will be resolved in the future when work on move constructors in D is complete.


### New Utilities


The language gets an interesting new compile-time trait [in the form of `getLocation`](https://dlang.org/spec/traits.html#getLocation). Given a symbol, this trait will return a tuple containing the file name, line number, and column number at which the symbol appears in the source code. This opens the door to more informative debug logging and error reporting beyond the functionality already available via `__FILE__` and `__LINE__`. And I'm sure folks will find other uses for it.

The standard library utility module `std.file`, which provides a lot of convenience functions for working with files as a unit, now [has the new function `getAvailableDiskSpace`](https://dlang.org/phobos/std_file.html#.getAvailableDiskSpace). Give it a directory path on Windows, or the path to a directory or file on Posix, and it will give you the number of bytes available on that path.


### Other News


[The Symmetry Autumn of Code 2019 participants](https://dlang.org/blog/2019/08/25/saoc-2019-projects-and-participants/) all have mentors now and they are hard at work laying out their milestones. Milestone 1 officially kicks off on September 15, after which we can expect to see weekly updates from the participants [in the General forum](https://forum.dlang.org/group/general).

[Google Summer of Code 2019 has come to an end](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2019/09/thats-wrap-for-google-summer-of-code.html). Five of our students submitted their work at the end of August. You can find information about their projects and view their code submissions [from our GSOC projects page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/6103365956665344/#!). Congratulations to all who participated!

The D Language Foundation is currently in discussions to put some of the Human Resource Fund to use in finalizing LDC support for iOS and Android. Hopefully, I'll have details to report on that front in the very near future. In the meantime, please help us raise the HR Fund even higher than it is now. There's some important work waiting to be done that will require as much money as we can throw at it. You can [donate any amount directly to the HR Fund Campaign](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NTUxOTc=) or use the special campaign we set up to [send $60 to the HR Fund and get a DConf 2019 t-shirt](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NTg4NzE=) in return.

Speaking of t-shirts, thanks to everyone who has made a purchase [in our DLang Swag Emporium](https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326). You've helped us raise over $77 so far, all of which will go to the General Fund. If you haven't yet dropped in, [what are you waiting for](https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326)? We've got t-shirts, stickers, and coffee mugs, with updates coming soon. It's an easy way to support our favorite programming language!
