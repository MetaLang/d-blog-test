### Symmetry Autumn of Code 2020


![Symmetry Investments logo](http://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/logo-1.png)

The 3rd annual Symmetry Autumn of Code (SAoC) is on! 

From now until August 16th, we're accepting applications from motivated coders interested in getting paid to improve the D ecosystem. The SAoC committee will review all submissions and, based on the quality of the applications received, select a number of applicants to complete four milestones from September 15th to January 15th. Each participant will receive $1000 for the successful completion of each of the first three milestones, and one of them will receive an additional $1000 and a free trip (reimbursement for transportation and accommodation, and free registration) to the next real-world DConf (given the ongoing pandemic, we can't yet be sure when that will be). 

Anyone interested in programming D is welcome to apply, but preference will be given to those who can provide proof of enrollment in undergraduate or postgraduate university programs. For details on how to apply, see [the SAoC 2020 page here at the D Blog](https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/).

The participants will need mentors, so we invite experienced D programmers interested in lending a hand to get in touch and to keep an eye out in the forums for any SAoC applicants in search of a mentor. As with the previous edition of SAoC, all mentors whose mentee completes the event will be guaranteed a one-time payment of $500 after the final milestone (mentors of unsuccessful mentees may still be eligible for the payment at the discretion of the SAoC committee). Potential mentors [can follow the same link](https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/) for details on their responsibilities and how to make themselves available.

We're also looking for community input on potential SAoC projects. If there's any work you're aware of that needs doing in the D ecosystem and which may keep a lone coder occupied for 20 hours per week over four months, please let us know! Once again, details on how submit your suggestions and what sort of information we're looking for can be found [on the SAoC 2020 page](https://dlang.org/blog/symmetry-autumn-of-code/).

Our SAoC 2019 selectee, Roberto Rosmaninho, was all set to attend DConf 2020 and we were all looking forward to meeting him. He'll still be eligible to claim his free DConf trip at the next available opportunity. 

SAoC would not be possible without the generosity of Symmetry Investments. A big thanks to them for once again funding this event and for the other ways, both financial and otherwise, they contribute back to the D programming language community.



### Finances



![](http://dlang.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/d3.png)Thanks to everyone who has shopped in [the DLang Swag Emporium](https://www.zazzle.com/store/dlang_swag?rf=238129799288374326)! To date, the D Language Foundation has received over $177 in royalties and referral fees. Thanks are also in order to those who have supported the foundation [through smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/). Your purchases have brought over $288 into the General Fund. Amazon Smile is perhaps the easiest way to support D financially if you shop through Amazon's .com domain (the D Language Foundation is unavailable in other Amazon domains). If you've never done so, you can select a charitable foundation (the D Language Foundation, of course) on [your first visit to smile.amazon.com](https://smile.amazon.com/). Then, every time you shop through that link, the foundation will receive a small percentage of your total purchase. Check your browser's extension market for plugins that convert every amazon.com link to a smile.amazon.com link!

On the Task Bounties front, we may have closed out a big bounty for bringing D to iOS and iPadOS, but there are still [several other bounties waiting to be claimed](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NjI2Njg=). The latest, currently at $220, is a bounty [to improve DLL support on Windows](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/ODcyMDE=) by closing two related Bugzilla issues; 50% of the total bounty will be paid for the successful closure (merged PR and DMD release) of each issue. We welcome anyone interested in fixing these issues to either up the bounty or roll up their sleeves and start working toward claiming it. If you'd like to contribute to multiple bounties with a single credit card payment, or seed one or more new bounties with a specific amount, visit [the Task Bounty Catch-All](https://www.flipcause.com/secure/cause_pdetails/NjI1ODA=) and follow the instructions there. 

Finally, the question was recently raised in the forums about how to view the D Language Foundation's finances. Because the foundation is a [501(3)(c) non-profit public charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501(c)_organization), [the Form 990](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-990) that the organization is required to submit to the IRS every year is publicly available. There are different ways you can obtain the documents for multiple years, such as searching online databases or contacting the IRS directly. Several websites, [such as grantspace.org](https://grantspace.org/resources/knowledge-base/finding-990-990-pfs/), provide details on how to do so. The Form 990 does not break down specific expenditures or sources of income except for special circumstances (like scholarship payments). With Andrei's help, I'm currently working on gathering up more information on the past five years of the foundation's finances so that we can put up an overview page at dlang.org. It won't be at line-item detail, but we hope to provide a little more detail than the Form 990. I can't provide a timeline on when it will be available (I don't consider it a high priority task, so I'm working on it sporadically), but expect it sometime in the next few months.



### DConf Online?



Rumor has it that online conferences are actually a thing. Voices in the wind speak of the potential for an annual event related to D. I don't usually listen to voices I hear in the wind, but this time I'm intrigued...
